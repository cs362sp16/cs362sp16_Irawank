Documented Changes: 
1) I chose the card that I want to refactor, which is village, smithy, council room, great hall, embargo at dominion.c. 
2) Create a blank function for each refactored card. 
3) Copy the functionality from the switch statement to the function. 
4) Determined the correct parameter for each function. 
5) Repace the functionality in the switch statement with a function call. 
6) Add the function declaration of village, smithy, council room, great hall, and embargo to the dominion.h. 
7) Messed up some of the logic.
