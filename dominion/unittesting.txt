Code coverage: 38.71%
Things that I find: 
1) The bugs that I created for Council Room Card Function 
2) Bugs for Adventurer Card Function, it draws an extra card
3) Bugs for Adventurer Card Function, only draw two cards 
4) Gardens is only return -1 at the switch statement, but it does makes sense when I 
	think about it since gardens are only used later on in the game
	and it is not an action card and i do find the real function for
	gardens at another function at dominion.c
