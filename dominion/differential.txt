I found that almost all of my run result in "test passed". It is hard to find a dominion 
that is failed the test. However, I do find one dominion that fail the test and his test 
coverage was slightly lower than mine (around 62% compared to my 65% coverage). It is hard
to find which one is correct because the diff test doesnt really give us any hint at all. 
It only said that the result when running our testdominion is different, without any real 
explaination of which one is correct and which one is wrong. I personally doesnt really like
this testing method. Our case is not ideal because most of our code are similiar and it is 
hard to find a which one is the correct implementation since our dominion code are full of bugs. 
Nobody have the "correct and bug free" dominion code in our class, and with this diff testing, 
it is hard to find which one is the correct implementation since all of our code are not bug free.
