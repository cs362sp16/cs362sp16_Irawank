I found bugs in jiangzh's Council Room card implementation: 
    
    for(i=0; i<3; i++)
        drawCard(currentPlayer, state);

His Council Room implementation draws 3 cards instead of 4 cards 
My unit testing shows that there is a bug in his Council Room implementation.

From the unittestresults.out 
Number Of Card: 8
TEST FAILED: Incorrect Council Room Card Function 
File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:26.07% of 560
Creating 'dominion.c.gcov'

The fix will be changing the for loop condition from i < 3 to i < 4. 

    for(i=0; i<4; i++)
        drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
	
This fix will make a correct draw 4 cards.
