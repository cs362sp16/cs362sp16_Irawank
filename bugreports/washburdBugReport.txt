I found bugs in washburd's Smithy card implementation: 
    
	for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) 
	{
	  drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
	}

His Smithy implementation add 2 cards instead of 3 cards 
Both my unit testing and my random testing shows that there is a bug
in his Smithy implementation.

From the unittestresults.out 
TEST FAILED: Incorrect Smithy Card Function 
File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:27.71% of 563
Creating 'dominion.c.gcov'

The fix will be changing the for loop condition from i < 2 to i < 3. 

	for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) 
	{
	  drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
	}
	
This fix will make a correct 3 cards addition.
